# Special-Topics-Project
Build and implement a dual-authentication system with self-destruct using Raspberry Pi Picos.
I randomly assigned the pins, so those need to be fixed.
Please comment next to anychanges and please initial who made the changes please.
If something goes fully wrong, I have maintained a copy or the OG code I posted on here.
If there is something on here you are familiar with, feel free to work on that.
